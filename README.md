# Ultra Skills

Editable source repo for OpenClaw skills, runnable workflow packages, reusable roles, shared reference packages, and conventions.

Use this repo when you want to:
- find the right skill for a task
- update how a skill behaves at runtime
- reuse a role instead of copying role prose into a skill
- reuse reference material that should not be an active skill
- keep shared repo conventions in one place

Local OpenClaw reads skills directly from this repo's `SKILL.md` files, so packaged `.skill` bundles are not needed for normal local use.

## Start here

If you need...
- a runnable skill -> go to [`skills/`](#skill-index)
- a runnable multi-stage workflow -> go to [`workflows/`](workflows/)
- reusable reference material that is not a runnable skill -> go to [`shared/`](#shared-reference-packages)
- a reusable reviewer/writer/specialist role -> go to [`roles/`](#role-index)
- a repo-level shared rule or memory convention -> go to [`conventions/`](#conventions)
- to create or rewrite a skill -> start with [`workflows/create-skill`](workflows/create-skill/)

## How this repo works

Think of the repo in six layers:

1. `skills/` — executable skill source
   - each skill lives in its own folder
   - runtime entrypoint is `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
   - references, scripts, and assets live beside it

2. `workflows/` — runnable multi-stage process packages
   - each migrated workflow lives in `workflows/<skill-name>/`
   - `workflow.toml` is the runtime graph
   - schemas, templates, and other runtime sub-files live beside it

3. `roles/` — reusable role contracts
   - these are not runnable skills
   - they hold canonical specialist identity, rubric, and learnings
   - skills should load and adapt them instead of re-owning the same role prose

4. `agents/` — generated Codex custom-agent files
   - these are generated from `roles/`
   - they let Codex spawn the same specialist roles as subagents
   - do not edit them by hand; regenerate them after role changes

5. `conventions/` — repo-level defaults
   - shared conventions that multiple roles or skills may reference
   - use these when the rule is broader than one skill but narrower than general repo docs

6. `shared/` — reusable reference packages
   - these are not runnable skills
   - use them for cross-skill contracts, snippets, or authoring references that should stay out of the active skill catalog

## Repo map

```text
skills/         runnable skill folders
workflows/      runnable multi-stage workflow packages
roles/          reusable role contracts
agents/         generated Codex custom-agent TOML files
shared/         reusable reference packages, not runtime skills
conventions/    shared repo-level conventions
README.md       onboarding + repo map
```

Canonical shapes:

### Skill folder

```text
skills/<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md
  references/
  scripts/      # optional
  assets/       # optional
```

### Role folder

```text
roles/<Role-Name>/
  ROLE.md
  RUBRIC.md
  LEARNINGS.md
  references/   # optional role-local support material
  learnings/    # optional expanded role-local learning library
```

### Generated Codex agent folder

```text
agents/
  <role-name>.toml
```

### Shared package folder

```text
shared/<package-name>/
  README.md
  *.md          # reference material and snippets
```

When a canonical label and folder path differ, the folder path is the source of truth. Resolver scripts should use direct `roles/<slug>` path checks, not hardcoded role-name maps.

## Common workflows

### Find the right skill

- developer-facing README intros, technical launch framing, developer-facing product positioning -> `workflows/devrel-copywriter`
- docs, setup, usage, onboarding, API explanation -> `workflows/docs-writer`
- market-facing copy, copy refreshes, content planning, launch planning, pricing/packaging, sales collateral, competitor dossiers, customer research, cold outreach, or lifecycle email -> `roles/marketing` (start at `roles/marketing/ROLE.md` and follow the role's own task-type routing table)
- create or refactor a skill -> `workflows/create-skill`
- workflow-runner orchestration through CLI-returned instructions -> `skills/orbita`
- `workflows/spdd` — **What it is:** the full staged research, design, execution-ready architecture, implementation, and review workflow. **Use when:** non-trivial code work needs evidence, approvals, delegated implementation, or coordinated review. **Do not use when:** a direct edit or one focused engineering workflow is sufficient.
- multi-role read-only review -> `workflows/code-review-orchestrator`
- pre-implementation Researcher -> Critic research verdict -> `workflows/research-critic`
- approved closed contract -> backend/frontend implementation + verification handoff -> `workflows/implementation-harness`
- `workflows/red-green-refactor` — **What it is:** one evidence-bearing RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle plus independent review. **Use when:** a small behavior has a cheap deterministic test. **Do not use when:** the cause or oracle is unknown.
- `workflows/pair-programming` — **What it is:** parallel driver/navigator tracks with explicit write ownership, integration, and review. **Use when:** a bounded change benefits from two independent perspectives. **Do not use when:** one agent is enough or safe ownership cannot be stated.
- `workflows/review-fix-verify` — **What it is:** finding normalization, evidence triage, implementation, and independent recheck. **Use when:** concrete review or QA findings already exist. **Do not use when:** root-cause discovery or external comment transport is the actual task.
- `workflows/make-it-fast` — **What it is:** baseline-first, profile-guided optimization with comparable measurement. **Use when:** performance is the primary requirement and the workload is stable. **Do not use when:** the optimization or metric is speculative.
- `workflows/deep-debugging` — **What it is:** bounded falsifiable diagnosis with independent evidence judgment and one hostile reset. **Use when:** an observable bug has no exact causal chain yet. **Do not use when:** the cause is already obvious or no reproduction can be defined.
- design rationale and shared routing boundaries for those five workflows -> [`workflows/LIGHTWEIGHT_ENGINEERING_WORKFLOWS.md`](workflows/LIGHTWEIGHT_ENGINEERING_WORKFLOWS.md)
- architecture audit/proposal/approval/implementation -> `workflows/create-architecture`
- design-memory review/proposal/implementation -> `workflows/create-design`
- create, audit, simplify, or restructure a skill -> `workflows/create-skill`
- bounded repeated execution with explicit controller decisions -> `workflows/loop`
- small UI design -> implementation -> review -> PR smoke tests -> `workflows/frontend-ui-pr-smoke`

### Reuse a role

If a skill or workflow needs a reusable specialist voice:
- load from `roles/`
- in skill runtime instructions, resolve paths relative to the skill root (`skills/<name>/`), not relative to nested reference files
- for repo-level shared roles/conventions from a skill, use paths like `../../roles/<role>/...` or `../../conventions/<file>.md`
- for sibling skills from a skill, use paths like `../<skill-name>/...`; reserve `skills/<skill-name>/...` for repo-map prose, not runtime load paths
- adapt it to the current phase
- keep role identity in `roles/`, not in local copied prose
- after changing role material, regenerate Codex custom agents with `bun run agents:generate`

### Reuse a shared reference package

If a skill needs reusable instructions that are not a runnable skill:
- load or link the package under `shared/`
- keep runtime entrypoints out of shared packages; shared packages must not include `SKILL.md`
- from a skill, reference shared material with skill-root-relative paths like `../../shared/<package>/README.md`
- copy only the needed snippet or contract into the consuming skill when runtime loading must stay self-contained

### Add or update a skill

1. Start from concrete usage, not abstract theory.
2. Use `workflows/create-skill` when building or rewriting the skill.
3. Keep `SKILL.md` lean.
4. Push bulky or variant-specific detail into `references/`.
5. Add scripts only for deterministic repeated work.
6. Test with representative prompts before calling it done.

### Validate maintainer changes

- `bun run test` runs the repo test suite.
- `bun run schema-validation:bundle-vendor-ajv` rebuilds the committed `shared/scripts/schema-validation/vendor/ajv.mjs` bundle.
- `bun run schema-validation:check-vendor-ajv` rebuilds that vendor bundle and fails if the committed file is stale.
- `bun run workflow:validate` runs deterministic semantic validation for the checked-in flat workflow files under `workflows/*/workflow.{toml,json}`.
- `bun run agents:generate` rebuilds generated Codex custom-agent TOML files from `roles/`.
- `bun run agents:check` regenerates Codex custom-agent TOML files and fails if `agents/` is stale.
- `bun run validate` runs tests, workflow semantic validation, generated Codex-agent freshness, and the schema-validation vendor bundle freshness check.

Fresh clones can use the committed schema-validation library dist artifact directly; normal users do not need to build it after cloning. Maintainer checks and the pre-commit hook regenerate it when source changes.

## Skill index

### Writing and docs

- `workflows/devrel-copywriter`
  - What it is: developer-facing framing, positioning, launch copy, README intros, and messaging polish.
  - Use when: the main job is message hierarchy, payoff, tone, and believable product framing.
  - Do not use when: the main job is teaching setup, usage, onboarding, migration, or API behavior.

- `workflows/docs-writer`
  - What it is: documentation writing and rewriting for usage, setup, onboarding, migration, and API/reference clarity.
  - Use when: the main job is reader success through clear explanation and structure.

  - Use when: the task is job-specific cover-letter drafting.
  - Do not use when: the task is general docs or product copy.

- `skills/humanizer`
  - What it is: cleanup pass for tone, rhythm, and less robotic wording.
  - Use when: wording is technically fine but reads too AI-ish or stiff.
  - Do not use when: the real problem is strategy, structure, or missing facts.

- `skills/forthright`
  - What it is: compression/editing pass that cuts fluff without hiding the point.
  - Use when: text is bloated and needs sharper wording.
  - Do not use when: the real issue is missing structure or unclear task intent.

- `skills/caveman`
  - What it is: ultra-compressed reply mode.
  - Use when: the user wants short, blunt, token-efficient output.
  - Do not use when: the reply needs nuance, safety wording, or normal tone.

### Marketing and go-to-market

- `roles/marketing`
  - What it is: the self-contained Marketing role for market-facing work.
  - Start at: `roles/marketing/ROLE.md`
  - Use when: the task is copywriting, copy editing, content strategy, launch planning, pricing/packaging, sales collateral, competitor profiling, customer research, cold outreach, or lifecycle email.
  - Do not use when: the main job is developer-facing README/docs/adoption/trust work; keep that in `workflows/devrel-copywriter` or `workflows/docs-writer`.

### Planning, review, and implementation flow

- `skills/orbita`
  - What it is: workflow-runner host adapter skill for following runner-returned `next`/`continue --only-instructions` directives.
  - Use when: driving a workflow-runner run through CLI-returned host requests, worker delegation, approval waits, and exact embedded continuation commands.
  - Do not use when: the task is ordinary implementation, planning, research, or review that does not run through workflow-runner.

- `skills/grill-me`
  - What it is: scoping/interrogation helper for unclear tasks.
  - Use when: the real problem is still figuring out what should be built.
  - Do not use when: the work is already scoped enough for `workflows/create-skill` or implementation.

### Frontend and architecture specialties

React/Next.js best-practice guidance now lives under `roles/frontend/references/react-ui-patterns.md` and is loaded through the `frontend` role rather than a standalone skill.

- `skills/improve-codebase-architecture`
  - What it is: architecture improvement guidance and artifacts.
  - Use when: the task is reorganizing structure, boundaries, or architecture records.
  - Do not use when: the task is a tiny local fix with no architecture effect.

### Workflow and repo utilities

- `skills/github-ticket-intake`
  - What it is: intake structure for GitHub issue work.
  - Use when: the task is turning issue context into actionable scoped work.
  - Do not use when: the task is generic writing or implementation already in flight.

- `skills/obsidian`
  - What it is: Obsidian-oriented workflow support.
  - Use when: the task touches Obsidian notes/workflows.
  - Do not use when: the task has nothing to do with that environment.

## Shared reference packages

Shared packages are reference material for skill authors and workflow skills. They are discoverable from this README but intentionally excluded from the active skill catalog because they do not contain `SKILL.md` entrypoints.

- `shared/delegate`
  - What it is: reusable delegation-mode principles, worker contract, and inclusion snippets for skills that orchestrate workers or subagents.
  - Use when: a skill needs to describe delegation behavior, worker handoff constraints, merged reporting, timeouts, or approval boundaries without depending on an active `delegate` skill.
  - Do not use when: the user is only asking to toggle a runtime delegation mode; there is no installable `delegate` skill in this repo.

- `shared/go-to-market-context`
  - What it is: reusable GTM/product messaging foundation covering product overview, audience, JTBD, pains, alternatives, differentiation, objections, proof points, messaging hierarchy, constraints, and open questions.
  - Use when: a role or skill needs shared product/audience/messaging context before doing positioning, launch framing, campaign work, or developer-facing framing.
  - Do not use when: the task only needs a standalone workflow or artifact-specific execution with no shared context dependency.

- `shared/templates`
  - What it is: reusable artifact-format/output templates for immutable REASONS Canvas prompt/spec artifacts, architecture proposals, implementation plans, implementation handoffs, review handoffs, review verdicts, and fix-pass handoffs.
  - Use when: a workflow needs a concise Canvas/proposal/plan/review answer shape with clear source context, evidence, checklist, verdict, and transition fields.
  - Do not use when: the task is already approved for direct implementation or only needs a short ad hoc note.

## Codex custom agents

`agents/*.toml` files are generated adapters that expose `roles/*` as Codex custom agents for subagent workflows.

Source of truth:
- role behavior lives in `roles/<role>/ROLE.md`
- role scoring/checklists live in `roles/<role>/RUBRIC.md`
- durable role corrections live in `roles/<role>/LEARNINGS.md`
- role-local support material lives in `roles/<role>/references/`, `roles/<role>/learnings/`, or other `.md`/`.txt` files inside the role folder

Generation:

```bash
bun run agents:generate
```

The generator writes one TOML file per role into `agents/<role>.toml`. Each generated file embeds the full role-local material so the spawned Codex agent can follow the role even when it cannot read this repository at runtime. YAML frontmatter in role material is omitted from embedded instructions.

To use these in Codex, register the generated files from `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[agents.security]
config_file = "/absolute/path/to/Skills/agents/security.toml"
```

Use quoted table names for role names that contain hyphens:

```toml
[agents."frontend-taste"]
config_file = "/absolute/path/to/Skills/agents/frontend-taste.toml"
```

Do not edit generated TOML files directly. Update the role source under `roles/`, rerun `bun run agents:generate`, and use `bun run agents:check` before opening or updating a PR. Then restart Codex or start a new thread so Codex reloads the agent definitions.

## Role index

Roles are reusable references, not executable skills.
Use them when a skill needs a stable specialist identity across phases.

- `roles/architect`
  - Architecture fit, boundaries, seams, DDD alignment, record updates.
- `roles/backend`
  - Backend/server implementation and review judgment.
- `roles/critic`
  - Adversarial pressure on assumptions, scope, risk, and complexity.
- `roles/dev-rel`
  - Developer-facing framing, positioning, and messaging quality.
- `roles/marketing`
  - Marketing positioning, messaging, ICP/personas, launch/campaign framing, and objection handling.
- `roles/frontend`
  - Frontend/client implementation and review judgment.
- `roles/frontend-taste`
  - Rendered UI taste, hierarchy, spacing, typography, composition, and polish, with routed learnings by project type.
- `roles/performance`
  - Hot-path, latency, throughput, blocking work, and resource impact.
- `roles/privacy-data-safety`
  - Local-path leakage, repo-visible private content, retention, and consent safety.
- `roles/qa-reliability`
  - Failure handling, rollback/recovery, degraded mode, diagnosability, and test signal.
- `roles/researcher`
  - Research Canvas building, context closure, ambiguity cleanup, and readiness preparation before critique and downstream ownership.
- `roles/security`
  - Exploitability, auth, injection, secrets, and trust-boundary review.
- `roles/tech-writer`
  - Teaching-oriented technical documentation writing and review.

## Conventions

- `conventions/repo-architecture-memory.md`
  - What it is: repo-level convention for architecture memory in target repos.
  - Use when: a role or skill needs a default rule for context docs, ADRs, context maps, or similar artifacts.
  - Do not use when: the task only needs one role's local judgment with no shared memory convention.

- `conventions/repo-design-memory.md`
  - What it is: repo-level convention for design memory in target repos, with a short `DESIGN.md` router and downstream design-law files.
  - Use when: a role or skill needs stable repo-local design law instead of generic taste judgment.
  - Do not use when: the task only needs portable taste heuristics with no repo-specific design source of truth.

## Repo rules

- Keep `skills/` as the source of truth for skill runtime behavior.
- Keep `shared/` as the source of truth for reusable reference packages that must not be active runtime skills.
- Keep `roles/` as the source of truth for reusable role references.
- Keep `agents/` generated from `roles/`; do not hand-edit generated custom-agent TOML files.
- Keep `conventions/` as the source of truth for repo-level reusable conventions.
- Prefer loading/adapting roles from `roles/` over copying role prose into skills.
- Prefer referencing `conventions/` over inventing duplicated repo-wide wording inside one skill.
- Do not add extra docs inside a skill folder unless they are part of runtime behavior.
- Do not copy repo/editor docs into a skill unless that content is actually needed at runtime.
